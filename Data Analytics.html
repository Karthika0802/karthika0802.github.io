<h1 id="data-analytics-projects">Data Analytics Projects</h1>
<p>The following are a list of chosen Data Analytics projects which I have worked on. Please not that Data Analytics projects can be found at while hybrid projects will be placed in either. Most of these examples will be hosted on Kaggle instead of Github as I believe it has a superior interface for hosting Notebooks. If you would like to view my Kaggle profile in general, it can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/karthikayyala">here</a></p>

<h2 id="Anime Recommender">Anime Recommender</h2>
<p>Used data mining techniques and the sklearn library to create an Anime Recommendation Algorithm based on Collaborative Filtering using data the from the MyAnimeList Anime Rating Database. The model will take an anime from the list and spit out which other anime are most similar to it</p>

<h2 id="Airline Search">Airline Search</h2>
<p>Worked with a group uto create an airline and airport search engine, which could perform multiple relevant tasks including but not limited to getting the closest airports to a certain coordinate and getting the number of airports per state. Multiple tools were used including Apache Spark, Apache Sedona and Geopandas. My personal contributions included creating some of the data visualizations using Geopandas and helping other groupmates with their Spark enviorments</p>

<h2 id="2018-maine-2nd-house-distrct-analysis">2018 Maine 2nd House Distrct Analysis</h2>
<p>In this notebook I analyzed the 2018 race for Maine&#39;s second House District. Maine had adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Instant Runoff Voting</a> in 2016. 2018 was the first election cycle where it was used. The 2018 2nd House Race specifically was notable for the fact that it was the first election in US history to have had a different result due to IRV; that is to say had the rules not been changed, a different candidate would have been elected under First Past the Post.</p>
<p>In this analysis I broke down the totals each candidate had in each round and created a Sankey Diagram to visualize how many voters moved from each candidate to which candidate in each roound. </p>

<h2 id="polcompbot">PolCompBot</h2>
<p>A bot built for reddit which attempts to categorize a users&#39; political leanings on a 2 dimensional scale known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Compass">Political Compass</a> based on their posting history. The source code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Karthika0802/PolCompBot">here</a>.

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: This bot is no longer being maintained and can bug out or break at any point in the future</strong></p>

<h2 id="mushroom-heatmaps">Mushroom Heatmaps</h2>
<p>A fairly simple exercise in generating heatmaps between various characteristics of mushrooms (color, odor etc) and whether they were poisonous or edible. </p>
