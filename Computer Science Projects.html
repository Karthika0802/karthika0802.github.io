<p>The following are a list of chosen Computer Science proejcts which I have worked on. Please not that Data Analytics projects can be found at while hybrid projects will be placed in either</p>
<h2 id="shooter-game">Shooter Game</h2>
<p>A group projects created with 2 fellow group members uses the SFML library to create a shooter game. In this game, a user must shoot bullets projectiles at various ghosts attacking a tower which attempt to drain the player&#39;s health when hitting the tower. The game has both single player and networked multiplayer playing options.</p>
<p>The project was a group effort, but within said effort I worked on audio, projectiles and the money system. </p>
