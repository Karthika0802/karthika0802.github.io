# Computer Science Projects

The following are a list of chosen Computer Science proejcts which I have worked on. Please not that Data Analytics projects can be found at while hybrid projects will be placed in either

##  Shooter Game

A group projects created with 2 fellow group members uses the SFML library to create a shooter game. In this game, a user must shoot bullets projectiles at various ghosts attacking a tower which attempt to drain the player's health when hitting the tower. The game has both single player and networked multiplayer playing options.

The project was a group effort, but within said effort I worked on audio, projectiles and the money system.

## PolCompBot

A bot built for reddit which attempts to categorize a users' political leanings on a 2 dimensional scale known as the [Political Compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Compass) based on their posting history. The source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Karthika0802/PolCompBot). You can see the bot's output [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/polcompbot)

**PLEASE NOTE: This bot is no longer being maintained and can bug out or break at any point in the future**

## CPTS 122

Various smaller projects for my CPTS 122 class can be found [here](https://github.com/Karthika0802/CPTS_122). Readme pages for each individual project are in the process of being added
